 A class which implements the IndexedKey interface is a special class of Key, 
 which not only serves as a Key in MultiKeyMaps, but also is the mapped
 Value in one or more MultiKeyMaps of its own (hence the name, "IndexedKey").
 For example, the Author class could implement the IndexedKey interface and
 serve as one of the Keys in one or more MultiKeyMaps for the Book class 
 (indexing Books in Author order), and also have its own MultiKeyMap(s) 
 (indexing Authors in name order or other orders).
 * @param <K> the type of key (i.e., the class of object returned by 
 * the getKey() method)
